        <p className="mb-regular">
          'My father made him an offer he couldn't refuse. Luca held a gun to
          his head and my father told him that if he didn't agree to let Johnny
          go, Luca would blow his brains out.' So Michael, youngest son of Don
          Vito Corleone, introduces his girlfriend Kay to his father's business
          practice. His father is a gangster, a very important gangster. He is
          the Godfather of one of the most powerful and richest families in New
          York. His business is fear and murder. Michael, an innocent college
          boy, doesn't want anything to do with his father. He's different from
          the others in his family. All he wants is a quiet, peaceful, honest
          life with Kay. But this isn't as easy as he thinks. Things happen, and
          Michael begins to change. He slowly realizes that, at heart, he's a
          Corleone too. And, if he must, he can be as deadly as the rest...

          On the last Saturday in August, 1945, Miss Constanzia Corleone,
          daughter of Don Vito Corleone, married Carlo Rizzi. Her father had

          the guests had reason to be grateful to Don Corleone for their good
          luck in life, and they called him 'Godfather'* to his face.{" "}

          Standing next to him as he welcomed the guests were two of his three
          sons, Santino - or Sonny, as he was called — was the eldest. He was a
          tall, strong, good-looking man with thick brown hair. He looked
          uncomfortable in his white shirt and black suit. The second son,
          Fredo, was completely different. He was weak-looking and pale, with
          sad dark eyes and thin lips.

          Mario Puzo was born in New York in 1920. He has written many books but
          The Godfather, which he wrote in 1969, is his most famous. In 1972, it
          was made into a film by Francis Ford Coppola. Marlon Brando won an
          Oscar for his performance as Don Vito Corleone. Coppola and Puzo won
          an Oscar for the best writing of a film. Coppola, born in 1939, was
